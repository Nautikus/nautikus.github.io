  <strong>Hello!</strong>

Every month, CCP Games releases economic data for their game, Eve Online. I took the data and created some basic visualizations using:<br>

<code>R</code><br> 
<code>ggplot2</code><br>
<code>RStudio</code><br>
<br>
The code was put into an RMarkdown document for viewing [here](https://github.com/Nautikus/Eve-Online-November/blob/master/Summary.md)
