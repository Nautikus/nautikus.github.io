  <strong>Hello!</strong>
  </div>
<p>  <div class="manual-content">

I downloaded the data from the Kaggle Chopstick page and performed some summary statistics on length of chopsticks and their efficacy.<br>

Tools used:<br>

<code>R</code><br>
<code>Jupyter Notebooks</code><br> 
<br>

The code was put into an Jupyter document for viewing <a href="https://github.com/Nautikus/Kaggle-Chopstick-Ergonomics/blob/master/Analysis.ipynb">here</a>
