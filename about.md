  <strong>Hello!</strong>
  </div>
<p>  <div class="manual-content">

The idea of this site is to showcase various analysis and data science projects I work on. The main tools I want to use is:
<ul>
<li>Python</li>
<li>R</li>
<li>Power BI</li>
<li>SQL</li>
</ul>
<br>
From these tools, using the different libraries and frameworks available such as d3.js, plot.ly, etc.<br><br>

These will all be showcased, using different data sets I find. I want to take the datasets, and create visualizations that explain everything clearly and concisely.<br><br>

I am excited :)
